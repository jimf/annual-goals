# Annual Goals

These are my personal developmental goals, year by year. Thought it'd be cool
to make them publicly available and trackable.

## 2016

- [ ] Active public GitHub involvement (ongoing)
    - active at least once per week (52 in the year)
    - contribution to open source projects at least half of this time (once every other week, 26 / year)
- [ ] Give at least 2 meetup talks (likely [BucksCoJS][])
- [ ] Give at least 1 tutorial talk at work
- [ ] Attend 1 conference (TBD)
- [ ] Implement a small project in [Elm][], [PureScript][] or [ClojureScript][]/[Om][]
    - possible idea: web-based UI for verifying GitHub activity goals above
- [x] ~~Make my goals publicly available / trackable on my GitHub~~
- [x] ~~Finish reading [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix)~~

## 2015

_Note: 2015 is backfilled and incomplete._

- [x] ~~Contribute to open source project once per week~~
- [x] ~~Present at [BucksCoJS][] meetup roughly once per quarter on average~~
    - [Things You'll Love About ES6](https://speakerdeck.com/jimf/things-youll-love-about-es6)
